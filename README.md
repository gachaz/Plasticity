This code is simulator of a continuous-time birth-death process with plasticity
It was design to characterize the Baldwin effect as defined historically

The source is a STAND-ALONE standard C and can be compiled using (e.g.)
gcc -o plasticity_be -O2 -Wall plasticity_be.c

no specific library is required.

All details of the model is described in
Lambert et al., The Baldwin effect reloaded: Intermediate levels of phenotypic plasticity favor evolutionary rescue,
submitted to Am Nat in june 2024, accepted in 2025.

I have made special effort to keep the same notation as in the article.

I have also make sure that the code is as clear and easy as I can to be run, read and/or edited. 

Any questions should be adressed to guillaume.achaz@college-de-france.fr

I will be happy to help in any way if possible.
