This code is simulator of a continuous-time birth-death process with plasticity
It was design to characterize the Baldwin effect as defined historically

The source is   a stand-alone standard C and can be compiled using (e.g.)
gcc -o plasticity_be -O2 -Wall plasticity_be.c

All details of the model is described in
Lambert et al., The Baldwin effect reloaded: Intermediate levels of phenotypic plasticity favor evolutionary rescue,
submitted to Am Nat in june 2024

I have made special effort to keep the same notation as in the article.

Any questions should be adressed to guillaume.achaz@college-de-france.fr
I would be happy to help in any way
